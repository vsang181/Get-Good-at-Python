# Website interaction with Python — Part II

This unit has the following learning objectives:

1. POST Requests and Parameters with Python
2. Request Headers and Non-Text-Based Content

In the previous unit, we explored how to interact with websites using Python by sending HTTP GET requests and parsing the responses. We examined how to retrieve HTML content, analyse response headers, and extract specific information programmatically.
