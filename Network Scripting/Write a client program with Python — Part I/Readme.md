# Write a client program with Python — Part I

In this module, we will introduce the fundamental concepts required to create a basic network client using Python. Before we begin implementing actual code, it is important to understand how sockets work and how Python allows us to interact with them. Throughout this section, we will incrementally build a simple client program, explain the relevant socket methods, and prepare the foundation for more advanced network scripting later in this course.

This module covers the following learning objectives:

1. [Buidling a Basic Client](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Network%20Scripting/Write%20a%20client%20program%20with%20Python%20%E2%80%94%20Part%20I/Building%20a%20Basic%20Client.md)
2. [Socket Methods](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Network%20Scripting/Write%20a%20client%20program%20with%20Python%20%E2%80%94%20Part%20I/Socket%20Methods.md)

Before we dive into the client implementation, ensure that you are familiar with how Python modules work and are comfortable executing scripts from the command line. The next sections of this module will walk step-by-step through the creation of the client program, including testing it alongside a server.
