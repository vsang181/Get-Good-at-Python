# Capture and send packets with Scapy

This unit introduces **Scapy**, a powerful Python-based packet manipulation tool used extensively in penetration testing, network analysis, and exploit development. Throughout this module, we will explore how Scapy allows us to craft, send, receive, capture, and store packets with a high level of control—far beyond what traditional networking tools provide.

By the end of this unit, you will understand how to interact programmatically with network traffic and how to build your own packet-based tools.

This module covers the following learning objectives:

1. Introduction to Scapy
2. Scapy Commands
3. Capturing Packets with Scapy
4. Saving Packets with Scapy
5. Methods for Sending and Receiving Packets with Scapy
6. Sending a Packet with Scapy
7. Sending and receiving a Response from Scapy
