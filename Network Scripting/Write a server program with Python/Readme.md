# Write a server program with Python

Up to this point, we have focused on building a Python client that can connect to a server, receive data, and handle errors gracefully. In this module, we will complete the picture by writing the server-side component of our application.

A server is responsible for listening on a specific IP address and port, accepting incoming connections from clients, and then responding appropriately. Understanding how to implement a basic server in Python is essential for anyone interested in penetration testing, network programming, or building custom security tools.

This module will cover the following:

1. [Building a Basic Server](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Network%20Scripting/Write%20a%20server%20program%20with%20Python/Building%20a%20Basic%20Server.md)
2. [Testing our Client and Server](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Network%20Scripting/Write%20a%20server%20program%20with%20Python/Testing%20our%20Client%20and%20Server.md)

We will begin by writing a simple TCP server that listens for connections and sends a response to any client that connects. Once the server is in place, we will test it alongside our existing client program to observe the full client–server interaction in action.
