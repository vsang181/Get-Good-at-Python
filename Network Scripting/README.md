# Network Scripting

In this module we cover the following learning units:

- Write a client program with Python — Part I
- Write a client program with Python — Part II
- Write a server program with Python
- Write a port scanner with Python
- Website interaction with Python — Part I
- Website interaction with Python — Part II
- Capture and send packets with Scapy

Note that this module relies on knowledge of Linux administration, scripting, and networking. If needed, please review those areas before continuing.

Creating network scripts can greatly improve our flexibility, consistency, and efficiency when interacting with targets over a network. The ability to write our own network scripts helps us reduce repetitive tasks and understand how programs and applications communicate with each other on a deeper level.

In some cases, we can even write our own network scripts to troubleshoot tools when they are not working as expected. Additionally, writing our own network scripts can be useful when we do not have access to common tools — for example, on a compromised target. Transferring regular programs to such systems can be time-consuming and may trigger antivirus or other security defences.
