# Write a port scanner with Python

In this module, we will build on our understanding of sockets and client–server communication by creating a simple port scanner using Python. Port scanners are widely used in networking and cybersecurity to identify which services are running on a target system.

This module covers the following:

1. [Using the `socket` module to create a basic port scanner](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Network%20Scripting/Write%20a%20port%20scanner%20with%20Python/Using%20the%20socket%20module%20to%20create%20a%20basic%20port%20scanner.md)
2. Port Knocking

We will start by writing a straightforward TCP port scanner and then expand our knowledge to explore how a sequence of connection attempts can be used as a form of lightweight authentication via port knocking.
