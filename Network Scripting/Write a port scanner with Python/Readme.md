# Write a port scanner with Python

In this module, we will build on our understanding of sockets and client–server communication by creating a simple port scanner using Python. Port scanners are widely used in networking and cybersecurity to identify which services are running on a target system.

This module covers the following:

1. Using the `socket` module to create a basic port scanner
2. Introducing the concept of port knocking and how it can be implemented in Python

We will start by writing a straightforward TCP port scanner and then expand our knowledge to explore how a sequence of connection attempts can be used as a form of lightweight authentication via port knocking.
