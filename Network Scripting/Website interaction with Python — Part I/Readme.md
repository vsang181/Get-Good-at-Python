# Website interaction with Python — Part I

This module covers the following learning objectives:

1. Understanding the Transport Layer: Using the Python `socket` Module with HTTP
2. Working at the Application Layer: Making HTTP GET Requests with Python
3. Parsing HTML Content Programmatically

In this section, we will begin exploring how Python can interact with websites by examining both the low-level and high-level mechanisms involved in web communication. At the Transport Layer, we will use Python’s built-in `socket` module to understand how HTTP requests are transmitted over TCP connections. At the Application Layer, we will learn how to construct and send GET requests, retrieve website content, and process the data we receive. Finally, we will introduce techniques for parsing HTML so that we can extract meaningful information from a web page.
