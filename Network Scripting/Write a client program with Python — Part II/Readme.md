# Write a Client Program with Python — Part II

This module will cover the following Learning Objectives:

1. Error handling: `try` and `except` Clauses
3. Handling Unknown Data Size
4. Interactive Sockets
   
In this section, we will continue building upon the client program introduced earlier. While the basic client can successfully connect to a server and receive data, real-world network conditions—such as unexpected disconnections, malformed input, or unpredictable message lengths—require us to strengthen the reliability and functionality of our code.

By incorporating proper error handling, designing methods to manage incoming data of unknown size, and enabling interactive communication between the client and server, we significantly increase the robustness and usability of our networking scripts.
