# Files and Funcations

In this module, we will cover the following topics:

1. Working with Files
2. Python Funcations
3. Combining File Operations in a Funcation

Working with files can be incredibly useful when writing Python scripts. It allows us to retrieve data from a file and act upon that information within the code. Additionally, we can modify or even create files on the system. If we want to maintain logs or generate output from our scripts, understanding how to work with files is essential.

Functions also help us manage our code more effectively by breaking down the program’s objectives into smaller, modular segments. This not only improves readability but also enhances reusability and maintainability of code.
