# Putting It All Together

In this module, we will cover the following topics:

1. [Writing Programs in Pseudocode](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Python%20Scripting%20Basics/Putting%20It%20All%20Together/Writing%20Programs%20in%20Pseudocodemd)
2. Creating a Program Flowchart
3. Creating the Spider

We will now create a program from scratch.

We have covered a wide range of topics related to Python scripting. In this module, we will walk through the full development process of writing a complete and functional script that leverages many of the concepts we have previously discussed.

The script we are going to write is a web spider.

Before diving into the actual Python code, it is important to clearly define what we want to build, how we plan to approach the task, and write the logic in pseudocode to outline our process.
