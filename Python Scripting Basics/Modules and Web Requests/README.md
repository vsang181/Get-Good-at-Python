# Modules and Web Requests

In this module, we will cover the following topics:

1. [Importing a Module](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Python%20Scripting%20Basics/Modules%20and%20Web%20Requests/Importing%20a%20Module.md)
2. Web Requests

So far, we have covered various foundational concepts required to build Python programs. One of the key strengths of Python is its extensive library of built-in modules, which make powerful tasks easy to implement with just a few lines of code.

In this section, we will first learn how to create and import custom modules. This allows us to separate and organize our code across multiple files for better structure and reusability.

After understanding how to import custom modules, we will explore how to use pre-existing modules, such as `requests`, to make web requests and retrieve web page content. This forms the basis of interacting with web APIs and scraping data from the internet.
