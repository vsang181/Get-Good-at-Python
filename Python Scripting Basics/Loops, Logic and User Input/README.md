In this module, we will cover the following topics:

1. [Loops](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Python%20Scripting%20Basics/Loops%2C%20Logic%20and%20User%20Input/Loops.md)
2. [Conditional Statements](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Python%20Scripting%20Basics/Loops%2C%20Logic%20and%20User%20Input/Conditional%20Statements.md)
3. [User Input](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Python%20Scripting%20Basics/Loops%2C%20Logic%20and%20User%20Input/User%20Input.md)

In this section, we will build upon our understanding of variables and apply them within loops, conditional logic, and user input handling. These concepts will significantly enhance our ability to write Python scripts that are both functional and user-friendly.
