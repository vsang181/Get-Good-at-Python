# Checking the Installed Python Version

To determine which version of Python is installed on your system, use the following command in the terminal:

```
python -V
```

Output:

```
~ % python3 -V
Python 3.9.6
```

As shown in the screenshot, the installed version of Python on this system is `Python 3.9.6`. This information is important, as different Python versions may introduce changes in syntax or available features, which can affect how scripts are written and executed.
