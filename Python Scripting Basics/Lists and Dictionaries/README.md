n this module, we will cover the following topics:

1. [Python Lists](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Python%20Scripting%20Basics/Lists%20and%20Dictionaries/Python%20Lists.md)
2. Python Dictionaries

Up to this point, we have explored basic variables and how to work with them. Now, we will examine more complex data structures that allow us to store and manage multiple values within a single variable.

These structures—lists and dictionaries—are essential for working with collections of data in Python, and form the foundation for many practical scripting tasks.
