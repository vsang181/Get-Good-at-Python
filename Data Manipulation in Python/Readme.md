# Data Manipulation in Python

In this topic, we will cover the following learning units:

- [Python Data Basics](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/tree/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Python%20Data%20Basics)
- [Sets, Lists and Dictionaries](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/tree/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Sets%2C%20Lists%20and%20Dictionaries)
- Different Base representations
- Converting and Displaying Data Types
- Manipulating Binary large Objects in Python
- User-Defined Data Structures
- Data Structures as records

These concepts form the foundation of how Python stores, represents, and transforms data. By mastering these units, you will be better equipped to analyse information, process inputs, build efficient programs, and manage complex datasets—skills that are essential in security scripting, automation, and penetration-testing workflows.
