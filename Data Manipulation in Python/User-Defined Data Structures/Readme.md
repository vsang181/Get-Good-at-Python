- Growing trees in Python
- Working with FIFO queues

Python provides many built-in data types and structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. However, when solving more complex problems, we often need to create **custom data structures** that model real-world behaviour such as:

- stacks
- queues
- trees
- graphs
- nested lists or compound structures

The number of potential user-defined data structures is essentially unlimited, so it is useful to explore several common examples and understand how they operate in Python.

In the following sections, we will examine how to construct these structures manually, how they behave, and why they are useful in solving specific computational problems.
