# Manipulating Binary large Objects in Python

In this unit, we will cover the following learning objectives:

- Arrays of Bytes and Byte Arrays
- Managing BLOBs aas Bytes

Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) are commonly encountered when working with non-textual data such as images, executable files, network packets, or any form of raw binary content. Python provides several mechanisms to handle these objects efficiently, primarily through **bytes**, **bytearray**, and related transformation functions. As we move through this topic, we will explore how Python represents binary data internally, and how we can manipulate, modify, and inspect these structures programmatically.
