# Manipulating Binary large Objects in Python

In this unit, we will cover the following learning objectives:

- [Arrays of Bytes and Byte Arrays](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Manipulating%20Binary%20large%20Objects%20in%20Python/Arrays%20of%20Bytes%20and%20Byte%20Arrays.md)
- Managing BLOBs as Bytes

Binary Large Objects (BLOBs) are commonly encountered when working with non-textual data such as images, executable files, network packets, or any form of raw binary content. Python provides several mechanisms to handle these objects efficiently, primarily through **bytes**, **bytearray**, and related transformation functions. As we move through this topic, we will explore how Python represents binary data internally, and how we can manipulate, modify, and inspect these structures programmatically.
