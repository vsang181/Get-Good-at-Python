# Converting and Displaying Data Types

In this unit, we will cover the following learning objectives:

- Introducing Conversions
- Converting Integers
- Converting Bytes
- Converting Characters
- String to hexadecimal String

Now that we have established a strong foundation in understanding Python data types, we will extend our skills by learning how to **convert data from one form to another**. Data conversion is essential in many scripting, networking, and security tasks, especially when handling raw data, files, and protocol-level information.

We will explore the fundamental conversion functions and techniques that allow us to move seamlessly between integers, strings, bytes, and hexadecimal representations.
