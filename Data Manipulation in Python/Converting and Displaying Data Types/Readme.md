# Converting and Displaying Data Types

In this unit, we will cover the following learning objectives:

- [Introducing Conversions](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Converting%20and%20Displaying%20Data%20Types/Introducing%20Conversions.md)
- [Converting Integers](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Converting%20and%20Displaying%20Data%20Types/Converting%20Integers.md)
- [Converting Bytes](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Converting%20and%20Displaying%20Data%20Types/Converting%20Bytes.md)
- [Converting Characters](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Converting%20and%20Displaying%20Data%20Types/Converting%20Characters.md)
- String to hexadecimal String

Now that we have established a strong foundation in understanding Python data types, we will extend our skills by learning how to **convert data from one form to another**. Data conversion is essential in many scripting, networking, and security tasks, especially when handling raw data, files, and protocol-level information.

We will explore the fundamental conversion functions and techniques that allow us to move seamlessly between integers, strings, bytes, and hexadecimal representations.
