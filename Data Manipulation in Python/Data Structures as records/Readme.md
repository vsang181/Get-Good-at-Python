# Data Structures as records

In this unit, we will cover three key objectives related to organising and storing structured data in Python:

- Working with Data Records
- Working with Databases
- Working with JSON and XML

Each of these topics focuses on representing and managing structured information—whether in-memory using Python data structures, in persistent storage through databases, or in platform-independent formats such as JSON and XML.

These capabilities are essential for penetration testers, analysts, and developers alike, as data is often stored, transmitted, and processed in structured formats. Understanding how to read, write, manipulate, and query such data is a crucial skill in both cybersecurity and software development.
