# Sets, Lists and Dictionaries

In this unit, we will explore **sets**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**—three fundamental Python data structures that build upon the basic data types. These structures allow us to store, manipulate, and organise collections of values efficiently. Understanding how and when to use each of them is essential for effective scripting and data handling.

This unit will cover the following learning objectives:

- [Manipulating **Sets**](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Sets%2C%20Lists%20and%20Dictionaries/Manipulating%20Sets.md)
- Working with **Lists**
- Exploring **Tuples**
- Using **Dictionaries**

Each of these structures serves a different purpose, offers unique capabilities, and is suited to particular use-cases. We will examine their syntax, behaviour, and common operations, while highlighting how penetration testers and Python programmers can use them effectively.
