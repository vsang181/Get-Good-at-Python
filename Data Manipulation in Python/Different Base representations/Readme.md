# Different Base representations

In this unit we will cover the following learning objectives:

- [Manipulating Binary Values](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Different%20Base%20representations/Manipulating%20Binary%20Values.md)
- Octal Numbers
- Hexadecimal Numbers

Although we typically use **decimal integers** in Python, there are several alternative ways to represent integer values. The three most commonly used alternative bases are:

- **Binary** (base 2)
- **Octal** (base 8)
- **Hexadecimal** (base 16)

These representations are frequently used in networking, cryptography, memory analysis, and other low-level tasks. Therefore, it is important to understand how Python interprets numbers in these bases and how we can convert between them for calculations, storage, and display.

In the following sections, we will explore each base in detail and demonstrate how to manipulate these values programmatically.
