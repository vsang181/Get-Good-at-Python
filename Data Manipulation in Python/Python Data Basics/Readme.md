# Python Data Basics

In any computer system, the lowest-level representations of data—bits and bytes—form the foundation upon which everything else is built. Python allows us to work with higher-level data types that abstract away this complexity, enabling us to manipulate information more intuitively. These data types include strings, integers, booleans, floating-point numbers, and more.

In this Learning Unit, we will refresh our understanding of Python’s core data types and how to work with them effectively. Specifically, we will cover the following learning objectives:

- [Working with Strings](https://github.com/vsang181/Get-Good-at-Python/blob/main/Data%20Manipulation%20in%20Python/Python%20Data%20Basics/Working%20with%20Strings.md)
- Working with Integers
- Working with Floating-Point Numbers
- Exploring Complex Numbers
- Working with Booleans
- Understanding Python Bytes

For this topic, we will primarily make use of Python’s interactive console. You can start the interpreter with the following command:

```
~ % python3 
Python 3.9.6 (default, Oct 17 2025, 17:15:53) 
[Clang 17.0.0 (clang-1700.4.4.1)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

```
